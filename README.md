# odin_etch-a-sketch

This project is my attempt at building an Etch-a-Sketch with JavaScript.

The goal was to get comfortable working with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS while creating something interactive from scratch.

This project pushed my understanding of DOM manipulation, event listeners, and dynamic styling in ways I hadn’t explored before. There were plenty of roadblocks, but working through them makes me feel far more confident in my problem-solving abilities.

What I practiced:

Handling user input with JavaScript, updating the DOM dynamically, writing cleaner, more organized code, breaking down a project into manageable steps, debugging and refining features.

Right now, the project works—you can draw, change the grid size, and reset the board. But, the project isn’t fully complete—there are still features I’d like to add, like a color picker, an eraser, and maybe even a mobile-friendly version—but the core functionality is there, and that’s what matters for now.

This is just one step in my JavaScript journey, and I know there’s still a lot to learn. 

On to the next challenge!
